papa-parse-meteor
=================

Papa Parse 4.1.4 packaged for Meteor. To be maintained as Atmosphere package by Meteor Mogul.

Forked from https://github.com/harrisonhunter/papa-parse-meteor so I can play around with it and see if I can get worker option to work, and maybe upgrade to latest and greatest version of Papa Parse (now at 4.3.6).

## Upstream README

The excellent Papa Parse package packaged for meteor. Use the Papa command as per examples on http://papaparse.com/

NOTE: The worker option may not work in the meteor environment, be careful when trying to use it

See https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse for details on how Papa Parse works.
